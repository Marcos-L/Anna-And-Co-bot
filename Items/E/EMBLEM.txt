{"Name":"Emblem\r","Price":"5gp","Desc":"Holy Symbol: A holy Symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an Amulet depicting a Symbol representing a deity, the same Symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a Shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Pantheons lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A Cleric or Paladin can use a holy Symbol as a Spellcasting focus. To use the Symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a Shield.","Tags":[]}
