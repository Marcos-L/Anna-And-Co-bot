{"Name": "Star Map", "Desc": "You've created a star map as part of your study of the heavens. the map is a tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. you decide what form the object takes, or you can determine what it is by rolling on the star map table.\nif you lose your map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. this ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.\n\nyou can cast the augury and guiding bolt spells without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use the star map as the spellcasting focus. you can cast a spell from the map in this way a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.", "Tags": ["Druid"]}
