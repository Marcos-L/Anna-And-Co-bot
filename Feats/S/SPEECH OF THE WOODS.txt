{"Name": "Speech Of The Woods", "Desc": "You gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.\n\nyou learn to speak, read, and write sylvan. in addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. this ability doesn\u2019t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.", "Tags": ["Druid"]}
