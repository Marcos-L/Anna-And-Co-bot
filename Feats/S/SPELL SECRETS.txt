{"Name": "Spell Secrets", "Desc": "You master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies.\n\nwhen you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). you replace one energy type for another by altering the spell\u2019s formula as you cast it.\n\nwhen you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. once you change a saving throw in this way, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.", "Tags": ["Wizard"]}
