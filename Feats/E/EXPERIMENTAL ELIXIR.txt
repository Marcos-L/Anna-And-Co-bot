{"Name": "Experimental Elixir", "Desc": "Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. roll on the experimental elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. as an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.\n\nyou can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. when you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the experimental elixir table.\n\ncreating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.\n\nwhen you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. roll for each elixir's effect separately. each elixir requires its own flask.", "Tags": ["Artificer"]}
