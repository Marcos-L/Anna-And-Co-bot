{"Name": "Minor Alchemy", "Desc": "You can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. you perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. for each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. after 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.", "Tags": ["Wizard", "Transmutation"]}
