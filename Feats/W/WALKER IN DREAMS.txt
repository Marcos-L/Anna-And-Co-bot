{"Name": "Walker In Dreams", "Desc": "The magic of the feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.\n\nwhen you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle.\n\nthis use of teleportation circle is special. rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. if you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.\n\nonce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.", "Tags": ["Druid"]}
