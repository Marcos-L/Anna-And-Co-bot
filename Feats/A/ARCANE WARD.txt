{"Name": "Arcane Ward", "Desc": " when you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. the ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your intelligence modifier. whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. if this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\n\nwhile the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.\n\nonce you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.", "Tags": ["Wizard"]}
