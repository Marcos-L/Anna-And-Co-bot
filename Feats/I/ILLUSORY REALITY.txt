{"Name": "Illusory Reality", "Desc": "You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. when you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. you can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. the object remains real for 1 minute. for example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.\n\nthe object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.", "Tags": ["Wizard", "Illusion"]}
