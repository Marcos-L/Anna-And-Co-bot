{"Name": "Trance", "Desc": "Elves do not sleep. instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. the common word for this meditation is \"trance.\" while meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. after resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.", "Tags": ["Elf"]}
