{"Name": "Greater Mending", "Lv": "Level 3(VSM)", "Range": "Range = Touch.", "Mat": "Two Lodestones", "Desc": "Takes 1 minute to cast.\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn clack, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 5 ft. in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object. Also, unlike the cantrip Mending, this spell can be used on torn skin or broken bone. Using this spell on skin or bone does not undo the injury or grant any measure of healing but can be used to cease bleeding. A severed appendage reattached with this spell does not regain its usual capabilities and acts as a paralyzed appendage until Greater Restoration or a healing spell of 5th level or higher is used on it.", "Tags": []}
