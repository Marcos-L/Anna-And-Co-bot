{"Name":"Melfs Minute Meteors\r","Lv":"Level 2 (CVSM)","Range":"Range=Self.","Mat":"niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead","Desc":"Takes 1 action to cast and lasts for 10 minutes\nYou create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell - and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter - you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.\r","Tags":["Concentration"]}
