{"Name":"Magic Stone\r","Lv":"Cantrip (VS)","Range":"Range=Touch.\r","Mat":"Nothing","Desc":"Takes 1 Bonus Action to cast and lasts for 1 min\nYou touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.\n\nIf you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.\r","Tags":["Concentration"]}
